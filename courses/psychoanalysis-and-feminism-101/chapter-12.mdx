## Review of Key Concepts Learned

### Psychoanalysis Fundamentals
- **The Unconscious Mind:** Central to psychoanalysis, it encompasses thoughts, memories, and desires that influence behavior outside of awareness.
- **Defense Mechanisms:** Psychological strategies (like repression, denial, projection) used to cope with reality and maintain self-image.
- **Oedipus Complex:** A term coined by Freud denoting a child's unconscious desire for the opposite-sex parent, often used to discuss family dynamics.
- **Transference and Countertransference:** Critical concepts in therapeutic settings that involve projecting feelings onto the therapist and vice versa.

### Feminist Theories
- **Key Movements:** Understanding the nuances between first-wave (focused on suffrage) and second-wave feminism (encompassing broader social issues).
- **Critiques of Freudian Theories:** Examination of how feminist theorists criticize traditional notions of female sexuality and the patriarchal underpinnings of psychoanalysis.
- **Intersectionality:** A framework that addresses overlapping social identities and related systemic inequalities.

### Integration of Psychoanalysis and Feminism

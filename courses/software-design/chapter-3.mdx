# Chapter 3: Design Patterns in Software Development

## Introduction to Design Patterns

In the realm of software design, **design patterns** serve as tried-and-true templates for solving common problems in software architecture. Think of them as reusable solutions that can be applied to a variety of programming scenarios, much like a master key for multiple locks. By learning and utilizing design patterns, developers can make their code more adaptable, maintainable, and scalable, ultimately leading to more robust applications.

### Why Use Design Patterns?

- **Common Language**: Patterns provide a shared vocabulary that enhances communication among developers.
- **Best Practices**: They encapsulate best practices learned over years of software development experience.
- **Efficiency**: Familiarity with design patterns can speed up the development process since you won't have to reinvent the wheel on each project.

Dive into the different types of design patterns that developers commonly employ:

## Creational Patterns

Creational patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation. They help control this process by providing mechanisms to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

### Singleton Pattern

The **Singleton** pattern restricts a class to only one instance and provides a global access point to that instance.

#### Code Example: Singleton Pattern

```python
class Singleton:
    _instance = None
    
    def __new__(cls):
        if not cls._instance:
            cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

# Usage
singleton1 = Singleton()
singleton2 = Singleton()

print(singleton1 is singleton2)  # Output: True
```

### Factory Pattern

The **Factory** pattern allows the creation of objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. Instead, a factory method returns an instance of a class.

#### Code Example: Factory Pattern

```python
class Dog:
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat:
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

class AnimalFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_animal(animal_type):
        if animal_type == 'dog':
            return Dog()
        elif animal_type == 'cat':
            return Cat()
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unknown animal type!")

# Usage
animal = AnimalFactory.create_animal('dog')
print(animal.speak())  # Output: Woof!
```

## Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with object composition, helping to ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to do the same.

### Adapter Pattern

The **Adapter** pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.

#### Code Example: Adapter Pattern

```python
class EuropeanSocket:
    def connect(self):
        return "European socket connected."

class AmericanSocket:
    def connect(self):
        return "American socket connected."

class SocketAdapter:
    def __init__(self, socket):
        self.socket = socket
    
    def connect(self):
        return self.socket.connect()

# Usage
eu_socket = EuropeanSocket()
adapter = SocketAdapter(eu_socket)
print(adapter.connect())  # Output: European socket connected.
```

### Composite Pattern

The **Composite** pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly. It helps manage tree structures effectively.

#### Code Example: Composite Pattern

```python
class Component:
    def operation(self):
        pass

class Leaf(Component):
    def operation(self):
        return "Leaf"

class Composite(Component):
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = []

    def add(self, component):
        self.children.append(component)

    def operation(self):
        return "Composite: " + ", ".join(child.operation() for child in self.children)

# Usage
composite = Composite()
composite.add(Leaf())
composite.add(Leaf())
print(composite.operation())  # Output: Composite: Leaf, Leaf
```

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects. They help define how objects communicate with one another.

### Observer Pattern

The **Observer** pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, allowing one object to notify others when its state changes.

#### Code Example: Observer Pattern

```python
class Subject:
    def __init__(self):
        self._observers = []
    
    def attach(self, observer):
        self._observers.append(observer)
    
    def notify(self, message):
        for observer in self._observers:
            observer.update(message)

class Observer:
    def update(self, message):
        pass

class ConcreteObserver(Observer):
    def update(self, message):
        print(f"Observer received: {message}")

# Usage
subject = Subject()
observer1 = ConcreteObserver()
subject.attach(observer1)
subject.notify("State Changed!")  # Output: Observer received: State Changed!
```

### Strategy Pattern

The **Strategy** pattern allows the definition of a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one and making them interchangeable.

#### Code Example: Strategy Pattern

```python
class Strategy:
    def execute(self, data):
        pass

class ConcreteStrategyA(Strategy):
    def execute(self, data):
        return sorted(data)

class ConcreteStrategyB(Strategy):
    def execute(self, data):
        return sorted(data, reverse=True)

class Context:
    def __init__(self, strategy: Strategy):
        self._strategy = strategy

    def execute_strategy(self, data):
        return self._strategy.execute(data)

# Usage
context = Context(ConcreteStrategyA())
print(context.execute_strategy([3, 1, 2]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

## Practical Exercises

1. **Singleton Task**: Create a logging class that only allows one instance. Ensure that every log message is sent to this single instance.
  
2. **Factory Challenge**: Design a `Shape` factory that can create `Circle`, `Square`, and `Triangle` objects based on a string input.

3. **Adapter Challenge**: Create an adapter for a `LegacyPrinter` class that prints a string with an additional header and footer.

4. **Observer Task**: Implement your version of the Observer pattern where a `NewsAgency` acts as the subject, while multiple `Subscribers` can register and receive updates.

5. **Strategy Task**: Create a sorting context that allows the user to select between quick sort or bubble sort through a command interface.

## Chapter Summary

Design patterns are essential tools in a developer's arsenal, enabling efficient communication, best practices, and reusable solutions to common design problems. By understanding and applying the various types of design patterns—creational, structural, and behavioral—developers can construct software that is clean, scalable, and maintainable. 

With the foundational knowledge gained from this chapter, you can begin to apply design patterns to your coding projects, enhancing the overall quality and efficiency of your software designs.

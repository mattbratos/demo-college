# Chapter 4 - Rock Classification

## Introduction
Welcome to Chapter 4, fellow rock-hunters! In this adventure, we will dive deep into the world of rock classification—a fundamental skill in petrography that enables us to understand Earth's materials on a detailed level. Get ready to decode the secrets behind how rocks are categorized, which directly relates to their origin, mineral composition, and texture. By the end of this chapter, you'll be well-equipped to identify and classify various rock samples, setting the groundwork for more advanced studies in our geological journey.

## Overview of the Classification Schemes
Rock classification is the process of organizing rocks into groups based on their characteristics. Classification schemes provide a structured way to determine the type of rock we're observing. One of the well-known schemes for igneous rocks is the **QAPF diagram**, which categorizes these rocks based on their mineralogical composition. 

### QAPF Diagram for Igneous Rocks
- The **QAPF diagram** utilizes the relative proportions of quartz (Q), alkali feldspar (A), plagioclase (P), and feldspathoid (F) to classify igneous rocks.
- To use the diagram, you will need to identify the % composition of the minerals in the rock.

### Classification of Sedimentary and Metamorphic Rocks
- **Sedimentary rocks** are classified based on their origin (clastic, chemical, organic) and composition (e.g., sandstone, limestone).
- **Metamorphic rocks** are classified based on texture (foliated vs non-foliated) and mineral content (e.g., schist, gneiss).

## Criteria for Classification: Texture and Mineralogy
The two main criteria used for classifying rocks are:

### Texture
- Refers to the size, shape, and arrangement of mineral grains in a rock.
- Key terms:
  - **Coarse-grained:** Easily visible crystals (e.g., granite).
  - **Fine-grained:** Crystals not visible to the naked eye (e.g., basalt).
  - **Glassy:** Lacks crystals and appears shiny (e.g., obsidian).
  - **Porphyritic:** Mix of coarse and fine grains (e.g., porphyry).

### Mineralogy
- The type and abundance of minerals within the rock.
- Common minerals to identify:
  - **Quartz:** Hard, glassy, and resistant.
  - **Feldspar:** Often pink or white; the most abundant mineral group.
  - **Mica:** Thin, flaky sheets (e.g., biotite and muscovite).

## Practical Exercises on Identifying Rock Samples
Get ready to put your new knowledge into practice! Here are some hands-on exercises to aid your rock classification skills.

### Exercise 1: Rock Identification Challenge
Gather a few rock samples (or use images if real samples are not available). For each sample, determine the following:
- **Texture:** Classify using the texture criteria above.
- **Mineral Content:** List the main minerals present (use a hand lens if available).

> **Example:**  
> - Sample: A light-colored, coarse-grained rock.  
> - Texture: Coarse-grained.  
> - Mineral Content: Primarily composed of quartz and feldspar (granite).

### Exercise 2: QAPF Diagram Application
Using a rock sample with known mineral percentages:
1. Calculate the relative abundance of Q, A, P, and F.
2. Plot your findings on the QAPF diagram.
3. Classify the rock type based on your plot.

```python
# Example Code for Rock Composition
# Assume you've measured these percentages
quartz_percentage = 60
alkali_feldspar_percentage = 20
plagioclase_percentage = 15
feldspathoid_percentage = 5

total = quartz_percentage + alkali_feldspar_percentage + plagioclase_percentage + feldspathoid_percentage
print(f"Total Composition: {total}%")
print(f"Classify the rock based on the QAPF diagram.")
```

## Chapter Summary
In this chapter, we've explored the world of rock classification, learning how to categorize samples based on established schemes like the QAPF diagram. We’ve dissected the criteria of texture and mineralogy, giving you the tools to identify rocks in the field. Engaging in our hands-on exercises not only solidified your understanding but also prepared you for the upcoming chapters where we'll dive into petrographic techniques. Now, you're ready to apply your classification skills as we move forward!

# Chapter 2: Physical Infrastructure: How the Internet is Built

Now that we understand the internet's history, let's explore the physical components that actually make the internet work. While we often think of the internet as something invisible or "in the cloud," it's in fact built on tangible infrastructure spanning the globe.

## Undersea Cables and Global Connectivity

### The Internet's Backbone Under the Oceans

Despite advances in satellite technology, approximately 99% of international data traffic travels through undersea fiber optic cables.

- **Scale**: There are over 400 active submarine cables spanning more than 1.3 million kilometers across the ocean floors.
- **Construction**: Modern cables are about the diameter of a garden hose, with fiber optic strands protected by layers of copper and plastic.
- **Capacity**: A single modern cable can carry terabits of data per second.

### Key Submarine Cable Routes

- **Transatlantic**: Connecting North America to Europe
- **Transpacific**: Connecting North America to Asia
- **Intra-Asia**: Connecting various Asian countries
- **Europe-Africa-Asia**: Connecting Europe and Asia via the Middle East and Africa

### Vulnerabilities and Resilience

- **Physical Damage**: Cables can be damaged by fishing trawlers, ship anchors, or natural disasters.
- **Redundancy**: Multiple cables often serve the same regions to provide backup in case of failure.
- **Geopolitical Concerns**: Strategic locations like the Suez Canal contain "choke points" where many cables converge.

## Internet Backbone and Tier Providers

The internet backbone consists of the principal data routes between large, strategically interconnected networks and core routers.

### Tier Structure

Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are typically categorized into three tiers:

- **Tier 1**: Large international providers that can reach every other network on the internet without paying for transit. Examples include AT&T, Verizon, and Deutsche Telekom.
  
- **Tier 2**: Regional providers that connect to some networks directly but pay Tier 1 providers for access to parts of the internet they can't reach directly.
  
- **Tier 3**: Local providers that purchase transit from other networks to reach the broader internet.

### Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)

IXPs are physical locations where different networks connect to exchange traffic directly.

- **Benefits**: Reduces costs, improves speed and latency, and increases network resilience.
- **Operations**: Typically consist of one or more network switches to which participating networks connect.
- **Examples**: Amsterdam Internet Exchange (AMS-IX), London Internet Exchange (LINX), DE-CIX in Frankfurt.

## Data Centers and Server Farms

### The Engines of the Internet

Data centers house the servers that store and process the vast majority of internet content and services.

- **Scale**: Modern hyperscale data centers can contain hundreds of thousands of servers.
- **Components**: Servers, storage systems, networking equipment, power supplies, and cooling systems.
- **Energy Consumption**: Data centers consume approximately 1-2% of global electricity.

### Types of Data Centers

- **Enterprise Data Centers**: Operated by companies for their own use
- **Colocation Facilities**: Shared spaces where multiple companies can house their equipment
- **Cloud Provider Data Centers**: Operated by companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google to provide cloud services
- **Edge Data Centers**: Smaller facilities located closer to end-users to reduce latency

### Key Considerations in Data Center Design

- **Power**: Reliable electricity supply with backup systems
- **Cooling**: Maintaining optimal temperature for equipment
- **Security**: Physical and network security measures
- **Connectivity**: Multiple network connections for reliability
- **Sustainability**: Increasingly important with renewable energy and efficiency measures

## Last-Mile Connectivity

"Last mile" refers to the final leg of the telecommunications network that delivers services to end-users.

### Wired Technologies

- **Fiber Optic**: 
  - Fastest residential connection type
  - Uses light signals through glass or plastic fibers
  - Speeds from 100 Mbps to 10+ Gbps
  - Low latency and high reliability

- **Cable**: 
  - Uses the same coaxial cables as cable television
  - Typically offers speeds from 10 Mbps to 1 Gbps
  - Shared bandwidth among neighborhood users

- **DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)**: 
  - Uses existing telephone lines
  - Typically slower than cable or fiber (0.5-100 Mbps)
  - Speed decreases with distance from the central office

- **Dial-up**:
  - Legacy technology using voice telephone lines
  - Very slow (up to 56 Kbps)
  - Rarely used today except in remote areas

### Connection Methods Comparison

```
| Connection Type | Typical Download Speed | Typical Upload Speed | Latency    | Range           |
|-----------------|------------------------|----------------------|------------|-----------------|
| Fiber Optic     | 300 Mbps - 10 Gbps     | 300 Mbps - 10 Gbps   | 5-10 ms    | Up to 60 km     |
| Cable           | 25 Mbps - 1 Gbps       | 5 Mbps - 50 Mbps     | 10-20 ms   | Up to 10 km     |
| DSL             | 1 Mbps - 100 Mbps      | 0.5 Mbps - 20 Mbps   | 10-40 ms   | Up to 5.5 km    |
| Dial-up         | Up to 56 Kbps          | Up to 56 Kbps        | 100-200 ms | Unlimited       |
```

## Wireless Technologies

### Wi-Fi

- **Standards**: Various IEEE 802.11 standards (a/b/g/n/ac/ax)
- **Ranges**: Typically 30-100 meters indoors
- **Frequencies**: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands (6 GHz in Wi-Fi 6E)
- **Evolution**: Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) provides better efficiency in crowded environments

### Cellular Networks

- **Generations**:
  - 1G: Analog voice (1980s)
  - 2G: Digital voice and text (GSM, CDMA)
  - 3G: Mobile data (UMTS, CDMA2000)
  - 4G/LTE: Broadband mobile data
  - 5G: Enhanced mobile broadband, ultra-reliable low-latency communications

- **Infrastructure**:
  - Cell towers
  - Base stations
  - Backhaul connections to the core network

### Satellite Internet

- **Traditional Geostationary Satellites**:
  - Positioned 35,786 km above the equator
  - High latency (500+ ms)
  - Speeds typically 5-100 Mbps

- **Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Constellations**:
  - Positioned 500-2,000 km above Earth
  - Lower latency (20-40 ms)
  - Examples: Starlink, OneWeb, Project Kuiper

## Practical Exercise: Mapping Your Connection

1. **Trace Your Connection**:
   Map out the physical path your internet connection takes from your device to a favorite website. Consider:
   - What type of last-mile technology connects your home?
   - Which ISP provides your service?
   - Try using traceroute (Windows: `tracert google.com`, Mac/Linux: `traceroute google.com`) to see the network hops.

2. **Speed Test**:
   - Run a speed test using a service like speedtest.net
   - Compare your results to what your ISP promises
   - Test at different times of day to see how congestion affects performance

3. **Discussion Points**:
   - How does your physical location affect your internet options?
   - What bottlenecks exist in your connection to the internet?
   - How might emerging technologies improve connectivity in your area?

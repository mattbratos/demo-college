# Chapter 4 - Data Structures: Arrays and Strings

## Introduction
Welcome to Chapter 4! In this chapter, we’re diving headfirst into the world of **arrays** and **strings**. Why? Because these fundamental data structures play critical roles in how we store, access, and manipulate data in C++. Arrays provide a way to collect multiple values under a single identifier, while strings are clusters of characters that you’ll often need for text processing. By the end of this chapter, you'll be on the path to mastering these essential tools.

## Understanding Arrays

### Definition, Declaration, and Initialization
An **array** is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. This allows you to easily access a group of related items using a single variable name. Let's break it down:

- **Definition**: A fixed-size, sequential collection of elements of the same data type.
- **Declaration**: To use an array, you must declare it first. 
- **Initialization**: Populating an array with values at the time of declaration or later.

Here's how you do it in C++:

```cpp
// Declaration of an array
int numbers[5]; // This creates an array that can hold 5 integers

// Initialization of an array
int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}; // An array with predefined values
```

### Accessing and Modifying Array Elements
Once declared and initialized, you can access elements using their index (remember: indices start from 0!). For example, to access the first element of an array named `numbers`, you’d use `numbers[0]`. 

To modify an element, just assign a new value to it:

```cpp
// Accessing an element
int firstNumber = numbers[0]; // This gets the value 10

// Modifying an element
numbers[2] = 99; // Change the third element to 99
```

### Multi-Dimensional Arrays
Multi-dimensional arrays (like 2D arrays) allow you to store data in rows and columns. Think of them as a table or grid.

Here's how you declare and initialize a 2D array:

```cpp
// Declaration of a 2D array
int matrix[3][3]; // A 3x3 array

// Initialization of a 2D array
int matrix[3][3] = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
};
```

## Working with Strings in C++

### String Class and Basic Operations
C++ provides a powerful `string` class in the Standard Library, which simplifies string operations. Here are the basic operations:

- **Creating a string**: 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

std::string greeting = "Hello, World!";
```

- **Accessing Characters**: 
You can access characters using the .at() method or the '[ ]' operator.
```cpp
char firstChar = greeting.at(0); // H
char secondChar = greeting[1]; // e
```

- **Finding Length**: 
Use the `.size()` method to find the length of a string.
```cpp
int length = greeting.size(); // 13
```

- **Concatenation**: 
You can concatenate strings using the '+' operator.
```cpp
std::string name = "Alice";
std::string welcome = greeting + " " + name; // Hello, World! Alice
```

## Common Operations on Arrays and Strings

### Sorting Arrays
Sorting is a common operation. Here's an example of how to sort an array using a simple bubble sort algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define SIZE 5

void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) {
    for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        for(int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; ++j) {
            if(arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                // Swap
                int temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                arr[j + 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int arr[SIZE] = {5, 2, 9, 1, 5};
    bubbleSort(arr, SIZE);
    
    for(int i = 0; i < SIZE; ++i)
        std::cout << arr[i] << " ";
    return 0;
}
```

### Searching Arrays
Searching is equally essential. Here’s an example using linear search:
```cpp
int linearSearch(int arr[], int n, int target) {
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if(arr[i] == target) {
            return i; // Target found
        }
    }
    return -1; // Target not found
}
```

## Practical Exercises

1. **Array Creation**: Write a C++ program to create an array of 10 integers, initialize it with values, and print each element.

2. **Maximum Element**: Create a function that takes an array and its size as arguments and returns the maximum element.

3. **String Manipulation**: Write a program that takes a string input from the user and returns its reversed version.

4. **Sorting Exercise**: Implement a function to sort an array of integers using any sorting algorithm you like. Test it with an array of your choice.

5. **Searching Exercise**: Create a program that prompts the user to enter a number and checks if it exists in an array, using both linear and binary search methods (you'll need to sort the array first for binary search).

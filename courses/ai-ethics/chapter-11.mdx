#### Feedback Mechanism:
- Create a feedback form that includes:
  - Strengths of the presentation.
  - Areas for improvement.
  - Questions for further clarification.

### Discussion on Key Takeaways from Project Presentations

- After all presentations, participate in a group discussion to reflect on common themes or unique perspectives shared.
- Some prompts for discussion include:
  - What ethical dilemmas resonated with you the most and why?
  - How did different projects approach similar issues differently?
  - What are the implications of these ethical dilemmas for the future of AI?

  - Which concepts challenged your previous assumptions about AI?
  - How has your perspective on ethics in AI changed?
  - What do you plan to take away from this course into your future studies or professional work?

## Practical Exercises or Assignments

- **Self-Reflection Paper**: Write a 1-2 page reflection on your project experience, focusing on:
  - What you learned while working on your project.
  - Any challenges faced in applying ethical theories.
  - Future implications you see for ethics in AI based on your findings.

- **Peer Feedback Exercise**: Review two of your peers' projects in-depth, providing feedback based on the criteria discussed above. This will not only enhance their work but deepen your understanding of ethical considerations in AI.

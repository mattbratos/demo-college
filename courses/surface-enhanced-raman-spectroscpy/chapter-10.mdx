## SERS for Multiplex Biomarker Detection

### Overview of Multiplex Biomarker Detection
- Multiplex biomarker detection refers to the simultaneous measurement of multiple biomarkers, which can be critical in fields such as medicine and environmental monitoring.
- SERS provides sensitivity and specificity, making it an excellent choice for detecting low-abundance biomolecules.

### Mechanism of SERS in Biomarker Detection
- SERS relies on the enhancement of Raman signals when target molecules are adsorbed onto SERS-active substrates.
- By functionalizing the substrates with specific antibodies or aptamers, we can selectively capture different biomarkers.

### Example: Detecting Cancer Biomarkers
For instance, researchers can create a SERS platform to detect multiple cancer biomarkers in a single sample:
- **Substrate Preparation**: Gold nanoparticles functionalized with antibodies specific to biomarkers such as CA-125, CEA, and PSA.
- **Detection Process**:
  - Sample is applied to the substrate.
  - Detection is performed via Raman spectra analysis at specific wavelengths for each biomarker.

### Exercise
- **Assignment**: Select a specific disease and identify potential biomarkers. Design a SERS-based multiplex detection strategy, outlining the substrate preparation and detection process.

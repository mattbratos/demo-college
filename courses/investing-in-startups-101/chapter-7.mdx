  - Conservative: Prioritizes capital preservation.
  - Moderate: Willing to accept some risk for better returns.
  - Aggressive: Eager to invest in high-risk opportunities for high returns.

**Example:** If you prefer predictable returns, a conservative approach may involve focusing on startups that have reached profitability or have a clear path to it.

### Investment Goals

- **Short-term vs. Long-term Goals:**
  - Short-term: Quick flips and immediate cash flow.
  - Long-term: Wealth accumulation through gradual investment growth.

- **Emerging Trends:**
  - Sustainability, AI, and Blockchain technologies are hot sectors.
